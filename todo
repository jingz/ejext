bugs
---

- pager component does not update data when grid have added records
- uncontrol height of grid; when form is next under the grid which is under hbox mode

plan
---
- using Bootstrap and ExtJS for all images / or just FontAwesome
- alternative javascript syntax "js!" that act as "<js></js>"
- alias config option "w" stand for "width" and "h" stand for "height"

Todo
---
- copy padding/margins of parent container to its children's default config
